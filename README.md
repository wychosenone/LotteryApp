This application will mainly focus on analytical prediction to lottery games involve numbers. 
The applicable lotteries is LottoMax.
There are countless amount of people not only in Canada but also Worldwide, 
buying lotteries. Some of them are just having lottery fevers just for a while,
whereas there are also some people having strong sense of wining and regarding lotteries as a long-term investment. 
This application is built especially for these people.

**Why i choose this?**
The main reason I choose this as my project is due to that I am also a lottery enthusiast,
since it does not require a lot of time, money, and skills. You might think that everyone can be able to play this, 
and lottery draws are based on random pick, what pushes me to do this useless application? Well, I did some research 
and compared nearly a thousand group of numbers, came out with one solution that is there exists strategies that can 
help you wining. Even though the rate of wining some crazy million dollars are still low, at least it can prevent you 
from spending money for nothing, or at the very least it can make you some entertainments lol.
